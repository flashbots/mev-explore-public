## Ways to contribute

### Help us expand our protocol coverage by writing inspectors

Requirements: 
* proficiency in Rust or JavaScript
* understanding of smart contract logic

Inspectors currently missing include:
* Swerve arbitrage
* Bancor arbitrage
* Kyber Network arbitrage
* DyDx liquidations - existing work by @brockelmore [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-logs/blob/main/scripts/getDydxLiqs.js)
* Mooniswap arbitrage
* DODO arbitrage
* Cream Finance liquidations
* ESD/DSD incentivized clipper inspectors - existing work by @austin-williams [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-logs/issues/1)


### Help us improve the quality of our data

Requirements:
* no coding skills required
* an understanding of value flow within an Ethereum transaction

Our data collection approach is far from perfect and we need as much help we can get in spotting misclassified transactions. You can see some individual transactions we classify in the [Leaderboard](https://explore.flashbots.net/leaderboard) page of the dashboard.

There are several kinds of misclassified transactions:
* a transaction we've classified as MEV but isn't
* a transaction that has a different revenue and/or tx_fee than the one displayed

For any misclassified transaction you find, please open an issue on here for us to look at it, prune it from our db and add a filter to our crawlers to ignore similar transactions in the future or correct the calculation error.

### General feedback 

Requirements:
* be kind :)
